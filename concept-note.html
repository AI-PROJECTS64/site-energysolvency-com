        This Concept Note provides a <b>purely descriptive</b> view of how the domain name
        <b>EnergySolvency.com</b> can serve as a neutral semantic banner for the emerging field
        of <b>“energy solvency”</b> — the links between energy shocks, business models and
        solvency risks for companies, portfolios and territories.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        <b>Important:</b> this page does <b>not</b> provide legal, financial, investment,

    <!-- 1. CONTEXT & PROBLEM -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. Context & problem (2025–2032)</div>
      <h2>From energy security to solvency under energy stress</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The past decade has made it clear that <b>energy shocks</b> can very quickly become
        <b>solvency shocks</b> for certain sectors, business models and regions. Gas supply
        disruptions, power price spikes, grid constraints, decarbonisation policies and
        geopolitical tensions have translated into:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">Sudden changes in <b>input costs</b> for energy-intensive industries.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Margin compression</b> for companies unable to pass costs through to customers.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Volume risk</b> when demand is affected by price, rationing or substitution.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Asset stranding</b> concerns as transition policies accelerate.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Liquidity and refinancing challenges</b> when shocks are persistent.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        Without referring to any specific scenario set or framework, it is reasonable to expect
        that supervisors, investors, boards and infrastructure operators will increasingly ask:
        <b>“How resilient is this portfolio / system to energy stress, and what does it mean
        for solvency over time?”</b>
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The notion of <b>“energy solvency”</b> is one way to articulate this link between
        energy conditions and solvency outcomes. <b>EnergySolvency.com</b> is a descriptive
        .com domain intended to provide a clear, board-readable label for this theme.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. DESCRIPTIVE VIEW OF “ENERGY SOLVENCY” -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">2. A descriptive view of “energy solvency”</div>
      <h2>Framing energy & solvency without prescribing a model</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        In a descriptive governance perspective, “energy solvency” can denote the ability of
        a company, system or territory to <b>remain solvent under plausible energy stresses</b>,
        over relevant horizons, given its exposures, contracts, assets and policies.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Without being exhaustive or normative, this can involve dimensions such as:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Exposure mapping:</b> identifying where business models depend on specific fuels, grids, nodes or contracts.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Price & volume stress:</b> sensitivity of revenues, costs and cash flows to price spikes, demand shifts or rationing.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Security of supply:</b> diversification (or lack thereof) in sources, routes, counterparties and infrastructures.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Transition paths:</b> potential effects of decarbonisation policies, carbon pricing and technology shifts on solvency.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Financing & capital:</b> ability to fund the energy transition and absorb shocks without undermining solvency metrics.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        <b>EnergySolvency.com</b> does not impose any particular methodology, metric or stress
        design. It is a <b>semantic banner</b> that an acquirer may use to name or support its
        own frameworks, observatories, dashboards or narratives.

    <!-- 3. WHY BOARDS & CFOS SHOULD CARE -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. Why Boards & CFOs should care</div>
      <h2>Energy solvency as a strategic governance topic</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For Boards, Risk Committees and CFOs, energy-related questions are not limited to
        commodity hedging or procurement. They cut across:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Business model resilience</b> under prolonged energy stress.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Capital allocation</b> between maintaining current operations and investing in transition.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Counterparty and sector concentrations</b> in portfolios exposed to the same energy nodes or policies.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Reputational and policy risk</b> if energy-intensive activities are misaligned with emerging expectations.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Interaction with climate, nature and water risks</b>, where energy is a key input into adaptation and mitigation.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        A neutral label such as <b>“Energy Solvency”</b> can help senior management and boards:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">Frame a <b>cross-cutting conversation</b> between finance, risk, strategy and infrastructure teams.</div>
        <div class="chip">Anchor a <b>multi-year programme</b> without locking it into a single scenario set or regulatory cycle.</div>
        <div class="chip">Communicate with <b>supervisors, investors and stakeholders</b> in a clear and non-promotional way.</div>
      </div>

      <h2>A clear, global banner for a potentially enduring theme</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Several characteristics make <b>EnergySolvency.com</b> potentially attractive for
